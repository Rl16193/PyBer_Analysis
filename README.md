# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization 

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to visualize the ride statistcal data to show the summary per city type and show weekly fare collected per city type.

## Results

From the ride summary dataframe we can see that the urban city type has the highest number of rides, drivers and fare collected during the analysis period with the value dropping drastically from urban to rural city type.
However, the rural city type has the highest average fare collected per ride and average fare collected per driver.

From the weekly fare collected line chart a similar observation can be made where the urban city type collects higher total fare.

## Summary

To address disparities:
1. We can provide incentives to the drivers operating in rural and suburban city types (offer additional income per ride) to increase the concentration of drivers.
2. We can do the same thing for people using the app where they can get discount on the ride fares to increase the activity on the app in rural and suburban markets.
3. We can try to implement additional services in rural and suburban ares, such as food delivery, package delivery to increase user and rider activity.

The total amount generated from each city type may be similar if these recommendations are implemented.
